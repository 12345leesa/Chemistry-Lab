Lutfi, Achmad & Hidayah, Rusly. (2021). Gamification for Learning Media: Learning Chemistry with Games Based on Smartphone. Journal of Physics: Conference Series. 1899. 012167. 10.1088/1742-6596/1899/1/012167. This research aims to determine the effectiveness of smartphone-based games as a media for learning chemistry, especially hydrocarbons. The effectiveness obtained from the activities of learners, learner questionnaire, learning outcomes, power retention of the learning outcomes of students, and motivation questionnaire. The study was conducted at a high school in East Java Indonesia with one experimental class and one control class. The results of the study showed the activities of the students 90.47%, the student questionnaire 85.5% - 98.2%, learning outcomes achieve classical mastery 86.6%, the retention power of learning outcomes in the excellent category, and the student motivation questionnaire gave a percentage of 88.89% to 93.33%. Based on the results, then the game is based smartphone effectively used as a media of learning chemistry on hydrocarbon material. The advantages gained in a game that is able to eliminate the boredom learners when studying chemistry and makes power retention of the results of learning is high.
