Bayir, Eylem. (2014). Developing and Playing Chemistry Games To Learn about Elements, Compounds, and the Periodic Table: Elemental Periodica, Compoundica, and Groupica. Journal of chemical education. 91. 10.1021/ed4002249. Educational games are useful pedagogical tools that facilitate learning in an enjoyable way. To help students learn many interrelated subjects and concepts—such as the names, symbols, atomic numbers and properties of the elements, the placement of the elements on the periodic table, examples of everyday objects in which the elements are found, the properties of the groups on the periodic table, and the formation of compounds—three games were formulated. Elemental Periodica and Groupica are card games, and Compoundica is a board game. These games were used as activities during a two-day Chemistry Games Days event, with 250 students (grades 9–12) and 30 inservice and preservice teachers involved. The reactions of participating students and teachers to the games were noted while play was underway. The results indicate that this set of games provides an entertaining way to facilitate students’ learning about elements, compounds, and the periodic table. Playing these games may help students reinforce central chemistry concepts and review for exams.
