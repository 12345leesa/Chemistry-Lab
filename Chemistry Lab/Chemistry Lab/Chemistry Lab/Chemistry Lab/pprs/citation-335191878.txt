Wang, Bin. (2019). A new classification scheme for teaching reaction types in general chemistry. Chemistry Teacher International. 2. 10.1515/cti-2018-0017. General chemistry is a freshman-level class required for most science majors and pre-professional undergraduates. A variety of concepts are introduced in this course; among them, chemical reactions are fundamental, but remain a central topic. The author compared 10 textbooks widely used for college-level general chemistry courses. They all cover the three major classes of chemical reactions: precipitation reactions, acid-base reactions, and oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. However, significant differences in the way these textbooks present the material may cause confusion and misunderstanding for students, including when they move to upper-level courses. The author suggests a modified reaction classification scheme for general chemistry courses, which will provide students a more complete and nuanced understanding of chemical reactions.
